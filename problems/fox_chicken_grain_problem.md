# Fox, Chicken, and Grain Problem

A farmer comes to a river with a fox, chicken, and bag of grain. There is a 
small boat at the bank of the river allowing the farmer to cross the river 
with only one of either the fox, chicken, or bag of grain. The fox and chicken 
cannot be left together unattended or the fox will eat the chicken. The chicken 
and bag of grain cannot be left together unattended or the chicken will eat the 
grain. *How does the farmer carry himself, the fox, the chicken, and the bag of 
grain across the river?*
