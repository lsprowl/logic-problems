# Game Show Problem

You are on a game show with three doors in front of you. Behind one door is a 
fancy, new car and behind the other two doors are smelly, old goats. You get to 
pick a door and the host, who knows what is behind each door, opens one of the  other doors showing a goat. You now get the option of staying with your initial 
door or switching to the one remaining door in hopes of getting the car. *Do 
you switch doors or stay?*
