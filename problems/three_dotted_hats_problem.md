# Three Dotted Hats Problem

An old king is about to die and has no offspring to inherit the crown. He 
summons the three wisest men from his kingdom and puts them to a test. He tells 
them that he is about to put them in a room and have his aide put a hat on each 
of their heads. Each hat may or may not have a dot on it, but at least one hat 
will have a dot. The wise men may not touch the hats or communicate in any way. 
The first wise man to correctly identify whether his hat has a dot or not will 
become the next king. If he is wrong or he breaks the rules, he will be killed. 
Then the king sends all three wise men into the room and tells his aide to put 
a dotted hat on all three. After a few minutes, one of the wise men returns and 
proudly announces that he has a dot. *How did he know that he has a dot?*
