# Two Hundred Eyes Problem

Two hundred wisemen with assorted eye colors live on an island. No wiseman 
knows the color of his own eyes, but each wiseman is determined to figure it 
out. The wisemen can see the eye color of all other wisemen and can keep a 
count of the number of each eye color that they see, but they are not allowed 
to talk or communicate in any other way to each other. Every day a ferry stops 
at the island and allows any wiseman who has figured out the color of his eyes 
to leave the island. The captain of the ferry can see that there are 100 
blue-eyed wisemen and 100 brown-eyed wisemen, but the wisemen do not know these 
numbers. One day, let's call it day 0, as the ferry is leaving the island, the 
captain of the ferry yells back, "I can see someone who has blue eyes." *How 
many days later does the first wiseman leave, and what is his eye color?*
