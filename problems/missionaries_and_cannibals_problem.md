# Missionaries and Cannibals Problem

Three missionaries and three cannibals come to a river which they must cross. 
There is a boat at the bank which can carry up to two people at a time. The 
cannibals can never outnumber the missionaries on one side of the river, else a 
missionary will get eaten. *How do the six people cross the river?*
