# Burning Two Ropes Problem

You have two ropes which each take exactly 60 minutes to burn, but the ropes 
burn at an inconsistent rate. There are spots in the rope in which it may burn 
a little faster and spots in which the rope may burn a little slower, so you 
cannot tell how much times has passed by the length of rope which has burned. 
*Using these two ropes and a lighter, how do you measure exactly 45 minutes?*
