# Three Gods Problem

Three gods appear and are named True, False, and Random. True always speaks 
truly, False always speaks falsely, and Random speaks either truly or falsely 
in a completely random manner. Your task is to determine which god is which by 
asking three yes/no questions with each question directed at only one god. The 
gods understand you but reply back to you in their own language. In the 
language of the gods, the words for yes and no are da and ja, but you do not 
know which word means yes and which word means no. *In three questions, how do 
you determine the identities of True, False, and Random?*
