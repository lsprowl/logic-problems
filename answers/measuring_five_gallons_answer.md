# Measuring Five Gallons Answer

Follow the steps below:

1) Fill up the four gallon bucket with 4 gallons of water from the spigot
2) Pour from the four gallon bucket into the three gallon bucket, filling the 
three gallon bucket, so that 3 gallons of water are in the three gallon bucket 
and 1 gallon of water remains in the four gallon bucket
3) Dump out the water from the three gallon bucket
4) Pour the 1 gallon of water in the four gallon bucket into the three gallon 
bucket
5) Fill up the four gallon bucket with 4 gallons of water from the spigot

You now have 1 gallon of water in the three gallon bucket and 4 gallons of 
water in the four gallon bucket for a total of 5 gallons of water.
