# Russian Roulette Answer with one bullet

### Odds with spun cylinder
The cylinder is equally likely to stop at any of the six chambers. With one 
bullet in the six chambers, the odds of being shot with a bullet are 1/6. The 
odds for survival are therefore 5/6 or about 83%.

### Odds with unspun cylinder

Because there is one bullet in the six chambers and the first shot did not have 
a bullet, the cylinder started on one of five empty chambers indicated by the 
white circles above. With the cylinder advancing one chamber, clockwise above, 
there are four initial positions in which the next chamber does not contain a 
bullet and one initial position in which the next chamber does contain a 
bullet. The odds of being shot are 1/5 and the odds of survival are 4/5 or 80%.

Ask to spin the cylinder.
