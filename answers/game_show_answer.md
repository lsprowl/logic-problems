# Game Show Answer

When you pick an initial door, the odds that you pick the door with a car 
behind it are 1/3. The odds that the car is behind a different door are 2/3. 
When the host opens one of the other doors and shows a goat, the odds do not 
change. The odds that you initially picked the door with a car behind it are 
still 1/3 and the odds of the car being behind a door you did not initially 
pick are still 2/3. You can see that of the two doors you did not pick, one has 
a goat behind it and so the odds of the car behind that door are 0/3 making the odds of the car being behind the other door be 2/3. The odds of you winning a 
car if you stay with your initial guess are 1/3 and the odds of winning a car 
if you switch are 2/3. 

**Switch doors.**

Looking at an exhaustive list of posibilities, assuming you always initially 
pick door 1, shows this to be true.
