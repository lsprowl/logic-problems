# Three Hats in a Circle Answer

The "after a few minutes" phrase is key here. The wise man knows that he has a 
dot on his hat based on how long the other two wise men think about it.

* If you were to look at the two hats on the other two wise men and see two 
hats without dots, you would know that your hat has a dot and would immediately 
leave to go tell the king.
* If you were to look at the other two hats and see one with a dot and one 
without a dot, you could figure out if you have a dot or not by whether or not 
the wise man with a dot leaves immediately. Assuming he does not leave 
immediately, you must also have a dot and would then leave after maybe a minute 
of thinking to go tell the king.
* If you were to look at the other two hats and see two dots, it would take you 
longer to figure out if you have a dot or not. If you did not have a dot, one 
of the other two wise men would leave after maybe a minute because they could 
figure out that they have a dot (by previous bullet above). Assuming that no 
wise man leaves after maybe a minute, you must then assume that you have a dot 
on your hat and would leave after a few minutes to go tell the king.
