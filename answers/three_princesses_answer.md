# Three Princesses Answer

If you are looking at sisters 1, 2, and 3, ask sister 1 "Is sister 2 younger 
than sister 3?" and then choose the indicated younger sister.  

* If sister 1 happens to be the oldest (truth-telling) princess, she will 
indicate that the youngest (lying) princess is younger and you will choose the 
youngest princess.

* If sister 1 happens to be the youngest (lying) princess, she will indicate 
that the oldest (truth-telling) princess is younger and you will choose the 
oldest princess.

* If sister 1 happens to be the middle (mischievious) princess, she might 
indicate that the oldest or youngest princess is younger but it doesn't matter 
because whomever you choose as the younger princess will not be the middle 
princess.
