# Twenty-Five Horses Answer

**7 races are necessary**

Races 1-5: Divide the horses into five groups of five and race each group. This 
is indicated by each column in the table below with the race order going 
alphabetically down the rows.

Race 6: Race the top horse from each of the first five races together, 
indicated by the first row in the table below. If the race order is AFKPU, this 
determines that the 1st fastest horse is horse A.

Race 7: Race the bolded and italicized horses in the table below (BCFGK) to 
determine the 2nd and 3rd fastest horses. The 2nd fastest horse will be either 
horse B or F. If horse B is 2nd fastest, the 3rd fastest horse will be either 
horse C of F. If horse F is 2nd fastest, the 3rd fastest horse could be either 
horse B, G, or K.
