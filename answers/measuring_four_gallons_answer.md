# Measuring Four Gallons Answer

Follow the steps below:

1) Fill up the five gallon bucket with 5 gallons of water from the spigot
2) Pour from the five gallon bucket into the three gallon bucket, filling the 
three gallon bucket, so that 3 gallons of water are in the three gallon bucket 
and 2 gallons of water remain in the five gallon bucket
3) Dump out the water from the three gallon bucket
4) Pour the 2 gallons of water from the five gallon bucket into the three 
gallon bucket
5) Fill up the five gallon bucket with 5 gallons of water from the spigot
6) Pour from the five gallon bucket into the three gallon bucket, which already 
has 2 gallons of water in it, filling the three gallon bucket by transferring 1 
gallon of water from the five gallon bucket. Now there are 3 gallons of water 
in the three gallon bucket and 4 gallons of water in the five gallon bucket
7) Dump out the water from the three gallon bucket

You now have 4 gallons of water in the five gallon bucket.
