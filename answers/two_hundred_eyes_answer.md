# Two Hundred Eyes Answer

On the 100th day, all wisemen with blue eyes will leave.

If there was only 1 blue-eyed wiseman, that wiseman would see 199 other 
wisemen with brown eyes and would know that they were the one with blue eyes. 
The one blue-eyed wiseman would then leave when the ferry returns on the 1st 
day. Because this does not happen, the wisemen all know that there must be more 
than one wiseman with blue eyes. If there were 2 blue-eyed wisemen, each of 
those wisemen would see 1 other wiseman with blue eyes and 198 wisemen with 
brown eyes. Because each blue-eyed wiseman only sees one other blue-eyed 
wiseman but knows that there are more than one blue-eyed wisemen, they each 
immediately know that they must also have blue eyes. The two wisemen with blue 
eyes would then both leave on the 2nd day. This again does not happen, so the 
wisemen all know that there must be more than two wisemen with blue eyes. This 
trend continues until the 99th day. After the ferry leaves on the 99th day, the 
wisemen all know that there must be more than 99 wisemen with blue eyes. All of 
the blue-eyed wise men look around and see 99 other blue-eyed wisemen and 100 
other brown-eyed wisemen. Because each blue-eyed wiseman knows that there are 
more than 99 wisemen with blue eyes but can only see 99 other wisemen with blue 
eyes, they immediately know that they must have blue eyes too. When the ferry 
returns the next day, on day 100, all 100 wisemen with blue eyes state that 
they have blue eyes and climb aboard.
